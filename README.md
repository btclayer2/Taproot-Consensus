## BEVM Development Phases
The development of BEVM has undergone a deep reflection on the core design concepts of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and has gradually formed the current paradigm through multiple technical explorations.
### 1. BTC Layer2 Exploration
- **Goal**: Address Bitcoin’s limited scalability by using Layer2 solutions to improve transaction throughput.  
- **Lessons Learned**: While technically feasible, Layer2 solutions lacked strong ecological demand, meaning they did not fundamentally change Bitcoin’s usage or achieve broad adoption.

  - [BTC Layer2 White Paper(Chinese)](https://github.com/BitAgere/BitAgere_WhitePaper/blob/main/docs/BEVM_Whitepaper2023_CN.pdf)

### 2. Taproot Consensus
- **Innovation**: Combined Bitcoin SPV state channels with Taproot technology to enable decentralized custody and expand Bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities.  
- **Reflections**: Bitcoin (BTC) is already widely adopted as a currency in centralized exchanges and mining pools, with relatively limited demand for decentralization-based expansion. What truly requires enhancement is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism rather than BTC’s monetary function alone.

### 3. SuperBitcoin
- **Direction**: Proposed a new crypto system that shares the security advantages of Bitcoin’s consensus.  
- **Limitations**: Improved consensus security but did not solve the “dreamworld disconnection” in Ethereum-like VMs. Such systems run only within their internal liquidity environment and lack the ability to perceive and interact with real-world data and states.

### 4. BitAgere
- **Problem**: Identified parallels between Bitcoin’s mechanical consensus and AI Agents’ abstract cognition, leading to the concept of BitAgere.  
- **Innovation**: Based on SuperBitcoin, focused on solving mechanical consensus’ perception gap. AI Agents’ input-sensing capability is abstracted and connected on-chain, enabling crypto systems to have real-world perceptive power. This deep integration of Crypto and AI Agents forms the basis for BitAgere.

### 5. BEVM(λ) Paradigm
- **Discovery**: Through introspecting Bitcoin’s design philosophy, we formulated the BEVM(λ) paradigm. It provides systemic theoretical guidance by examining Bitcoin’s success from four core aspects: the Individual model, lambda calculus, consensus algorithm, and consensus-aware algorithm.  
- **Direction**: BEVM(λ) inherits Bitcoin’s principles of energy conservation and decentralized emergence while enhancing autonomy and intelligence. Powered by the Agere subsystem and supported by distributed stateless computation and consensus-aware algorithms, BEVM(λ) paves the way for diverse future applications and the comprehensive development of intelligent crypto systems.

## Introduction

The BEVM Taproot Consensus is an innovative design aimed at addressing the scalability limitations of the Bitcoin network by constructing a fully decentralized Layer2 solution. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's non-Turing complete nature limits its ability to directly implement Layer2 scalability solutions such as Rollups. The Bitcoin script contract layer can only perform simple “Transfer” operations and cannot support more complex smart contract functionalities. Existing Layer2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, rely on external decentralized nodes, which lack Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) trust mechanisms and have not seen widespread adoption.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to integrate all existing capabilities of Bitcoin to construct a fully decentralized BTC Layer2 scalability solution. This is achieved through the BEVM's Taproot Consensus, which combines Bitcoin's Taproot technology (Schnorr and MAST), Bitcoin SPV lightweight nodes, and a BFT PoS consensus mechanism.

## Key Technologies

### 1. Bitcoin SPV
- Efficient and decentralized synchronization of the Bitcoin network state.

### 2. Schnorr + MAST
- Utilization of Schnorr signatures and MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees) to enable threshold signature networks.

### 3. BFT PoS
- A Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to achieve high consistency and decentralization.

## How It Works

1. **State Synchronization**: BEVM uses Bitcoin SPV lightweight nodes to efficiently and decentralized synchronize the Bitcoin network state.
2. **Threshold Signature Network**: Built using Taproot technology, this network allows for decentralized state synchronization back to the Bitcoin network.
3. **Fully Decentralized Bidirectional Channel**: By leveraging the BFT PoS consensus mechanism, BEVM forms a fully decentralized bidirectional channel, achieving Layer2 scalability based on highly consistent BFT PoS consensus.
4. **Security**: The inherent security of the Bitcoin network is leveraged to ensure the robustness of the Layer2 solution.

## Conclusion

BEVM Taproot Consensus offers an innovative approach to achieving fully decentralized Layer2 scalability for the Bitcoin network. By combining Bitcoin's Taproot technology, SPV lightweight nodes, and a BFT PoS consensus mechanism, it overcomes the limitations of existing solutions and paves the way for broader adoption and enhanced scalability.
